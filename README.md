# Lid-Driven Cavity
#Development of C code for solving the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for the lid-driven cavity problem at two different Reynolds numbers, 100 and 400.

#Discretization: The problem was discretized using the finite difference method with specified boundary conditions on a 100√ó100 grid.


# Flow Through a Sudden Contraction
#Development of C Code: Created a C program to solve the stream function-vorticity equations for analyzing flow through a sudden contraction at Reynolds number 100.

#Discretization: 
#The problem was discretized using the finite difference method with specified boundary conditions on a 75√ó30 grid.

#Results: Generated plots of streamlines, velocity vectors, and u-velocity profiles at **
ùë• = 2 and  ùë•= 10 and calculated the recirculation length (Lr).
